                  renowned as a

                  healthy population of these majestic cats, offering excellent opportunities for sightings. It is a dry
                  deciduous forest with an arid habitat, receiving the least amount of rainfall among all tiger reserves
                  in India. This results in fewer patches of tall grass, along with an excellent network of forest
                  tracks, contributing to exceptional tiger sightings.
